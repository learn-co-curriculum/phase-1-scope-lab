TESTING HELLO WORLD
# Scope Lab   


## Learning Goals

- Understand how functions determine scope in JavaScript

## Introduction

Scuber's drivers are beginning to take down some notes about their customers.
Use your knowledge of scope to access and change some of these variables.

## Instructions

A word of warning. In this lab, you will practice doing some bad things. For
example, we'll ask you to declare variables in global scope, and write functions
that break down. You'll also need to use `var` to declare all variables except
when specifically instructed otherwise. We do this because, by testing the
limits and exposing the underbelly of a language, you can better understand it
and know what to avoid in the future.

**Fork and clone** this lab into your local environment. Navigate into its
directory in the terminal, then run `code .` to open the files in Visual Studio
Code.

Ok, these are your tasks:

- `customerName`: Declare a variable in global scope called `customerName` using
  the `var` keyword and assign it the value `'bob'`.
- `upperCaseCustomerName()`: Write a function that accesses that global
  `customerName` variable, and uppercases it.
- `setBestCustomer()`: Write a function that when called, declares a variable
   called `bestCustomer` in global scope and assigns it to be `'not bob'`. (Poor
   Bob.) Also, poor us, declaring a global variable from inside a function is
   one of those things we would never want to do normally, but is good for us to
   explore right now.
- `overwriteBestCustomer()`: See the consequences of declaring a variable in
   global scope, by writing a new function called `overwriteBestCustomer()` that
   changes that `bestCustomer` variable to `'maybe bob'`.
- `leastFavoriteCustomer` and `changeLeastFavoriteCustomer()`: Now declare a
  constant (using the `const` keyword) in global scope called
  `leastFavoriteCustomer`; be sure to assign it some initial value. Finally,
  write a function called `changeLeastFavoriteCustomer()` that attempts to
  change that constant - notice what JavaScript does when you try to change the
  constant.

When you're done, remember to commit and push your changes up to GitHub, then
submit your work to Canvas using CodeGrade.
